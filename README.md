# SpringHibernateNotes

##### Roadmap:
1. Set up development environment
2. Applying Spring Inversion of COntrol and Dependency Injection
3. Perform object to relational mapping with Hybernate
4. Leverage the Hybernate API to develop CRUD apps

##### Why should we use Spring? (will use S for short)

S is a popular framework for building enterprise Java applications
Learn both Java EE and Spring


##### Spring Core Framework Overview 

www.spring.io (documentation, tutorials, etc)

##### Goals of Spring

* Lightweight development with Java POJOs(plain old java objects)
* Dependency injection to promote loose coupling by making use dependency of injection. So instead of hardwiring your objects to get 
you simply specify the wiring via configurations or annotations. 
* Declarative programming with Aspect-Oriented Programming - add some application-wide services to given objects
* Minimazie boilerplate Java code
